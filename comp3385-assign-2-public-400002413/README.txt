1) The index.php file acts as a router for all the other pages so just use the links on the pages.
2) Inorder to run the SessionManagerTest use the --stderr option. For example, "phpunit --testdox --stderr SessionManagerTest.php"
3) There is a PHPUnit file inside my test directory because I have a Linux system and it was best practice.
